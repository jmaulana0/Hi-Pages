-- Steps to clean data
-- Assuming you don't need to explode a column that contains JSON or XML

1. Load & Inspect
- Load the CSV into MySQL
- Check row counts, column names, and data types

2. Clean Missing / Invalid Values
- Identify nulls in latitude, longitude, category, number_of_tradies, estimated_size, number_of_impressions, accepted
- Decide whether to impute, drop, or otherwise handle missing values

3. Check for and clean for Outliers
- Look for extreme values in estimated_size, number_of_tradies, or number_of_impressions
- Decide whether to cap, remove, or keep them based on domain knowledge


4. Enhance data
- Add extract features to data to check acceptance patterns later
- Fields to add include: hour of day, day of week, month, and weekend vs. weekday (boolean)


5. Extract Cleaned Data for Further Manipulation
- Extract cleaned data as .csv to be used for further manipulation by Tableau, Python, etc.

Extended logic for 2. Clean Missing / Invalid Values

Step 1: Assess the Frequency of Missing Values
If the percentage is:
- Less than 5%: Proceed to Step 2
- Greater than 5% and critical to analysis: Consider imputation (Step 3)
- Greater than 5% and not critical to analysis: Consider deletion (Step 4) or imputation (Step 3)


Step 2: Assess the Distribution of Missing Values
Check if the missing values are:
- Randomly scattered: Proceed to Step 3
- Concentrated in specific rows or columns: Consider deletion (Step 4)

Step 3: Imputation
If the missing values are in a:
- Numerical column: Replace with the mean or median value
- Categorical column: Replace with the most frequent category
- Datetime column: Replace with the median or mode value

Step 4: Deletion
If the missing values are:
- Concentrated in specific rows: Consider deleting those rows
- Concentrated in specific columns: Consider deleting those columns

Extended Logic for 3. Check for and Clean Outliers

Step 1: Assess the Frequency of Outliers
If the percentage of outliers is:
- Less than 1%: Proceed to Step 2
- Between 1% and 5%: Consider capping (Step 3) or removal (Step 4)
- Greater than 5%: Consider removal (Step 4) or transformation (Step 5)

Step 2: Assess the Distribution of Outliers
Check if the outliers are:
- Randomly scattered: Proceed to Step 3
- Concentrated in specific rows or columns: Consider removal (Step 4)

Step 3: Capping
If the outliers are in a:
- Numerical column: Cap at the 95th percentile or 3 standard deviations from the mean
- Categorical column: Not applicable
- Datetime column: Not applicable

Step 4: Removal
If the outliers are:
- Concentrated in specific rows: Delete these rows
- Concentrated in specific columns: Consider deleting those columns
- Causing significant skewness or bias: Remove them

Step 5: Transformation
If the outliers are:
- Causing significant skewness or bias: Apply transformations (e.g., log, square root)
